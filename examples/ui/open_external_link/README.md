# Open external links

Demonstrates how to handle external link navigation with proper user consent and security patterns. Shows link handling, user confirmation workflows, and guideline compliance for external navigation.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/open-external-link/.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

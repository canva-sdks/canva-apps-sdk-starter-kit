# Notification example

Demonstrates how to display toast notifications to users using the notification API.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: <https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/notification/>.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Message content is hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading.
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes.
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements.

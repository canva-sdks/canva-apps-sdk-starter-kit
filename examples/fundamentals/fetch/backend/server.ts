   * IMPORTANT: You must configure your CORS Policy
   *
   * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
   * ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS)) is an
   * [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)-header based
   * mechanism that allows a server to indicate any
   * [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)
   * (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should
   * permit loading resources.
   *
   * A basic CORS configuration would include the origin of your app in the
   * following example:
   * const corsOptions = {
   *   origin: 'https://app-abcdefg.canva-apps.com',
   *   optionsSuccessStatus: 200
   * }
   *
   * The origin of your app is https://app-${APP_ID}.canva-apps.com, and note
   * that the APP_ID should to be converted to lowercase.
   *
   * https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuring-cors
   *
   * You may need to include multiple permissible origins, or dynamic origins
   * based on the environment in which the server is running. Further
   * information can be found
   * [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuring-cors-w-dynamic-origin).

# Setup

## Getting started

Before using this example, you'll need to [add multi-account OAuth configuration to your app](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/authenticating-users/oauth-multi-account/#add-multi-account-oauth-to-your-app) in the developer portal.

Once this is done, simply run the example from the root of `canva-apps-sdk-starter-kit` with:

```sh
npm start multi_account_authentication
```

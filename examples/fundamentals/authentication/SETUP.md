# Setup

## Getting started

Before using this example, you'll need to [configure your provider details](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/authenticating-users/oauth/#prerequisite-configure-developer-portal) in the developer portal.

Once this is done, simply run the example from the root of `canva-apps-sdk-starter-kit` with:

```sh
npm start authentication
```

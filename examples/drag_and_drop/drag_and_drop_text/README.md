# Drag and drop text

Demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop functionality for text elements with configurable styling properties. Shows text formatting, typography card usage, and text insertion with custom styling.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: <https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/drag-and-drop-text/>.

Related examples: See drag_and_drop/drag_and_drop_image for image drag-and-drop, or design_elements/text_elements for direct text insertion.

NOTE: This example differs from what's expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content and styling are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization isn't implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements
- Feature support detection is basic. Production apps should provide better user guidance when features are unavailable

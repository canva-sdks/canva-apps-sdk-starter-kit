# Drag and drop text

Demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop functionality for text elements with configurable styling properties. Shows text formatting, typography card usage, feature detection, and graceful degradation for unsupported design contexts.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: <https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/drag-and-drop-text/>.

Related examples: See drag_and_drop/drag_and_drop_image for implementing similar drag-and-drop functionality with image assets, or design_elements/text_elements for direct text insertion without drag-and-drop.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

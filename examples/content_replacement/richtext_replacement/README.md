NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content and formatting operations are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading and comprehensive text editing capabilities
- Text formatting handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps should handle complex formatting scenarios and preserve user styling where appropriate
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

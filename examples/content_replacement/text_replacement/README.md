# Text replacement

Demonstrates how to replace selected plain text elements in a design with new text content. Shows simple text selection detection and text substitution patterns.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/text-replacement/.

Related examples: See content_replacement/richtext_replacement for formatted text replacement, or content_replacement/text_translation for advanced text transformation.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content is hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading
- Text handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps should handle various text formats and include undo functionality for better user experience
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

# Text elements

Demonstrates how to create basic text elements with styling controls including color, font weight, style, decoration, and alignment. Shows fundamental text insertion and formatting patterns.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: <https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/text-elements/>.

Related examples: See design_elements/richtext_elements for advanced text formatting, or app_text_elements for text within app elements.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content and styling are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide comprehensive text editing interfaces or dynamic content loading
- Font validation and fallback handling is not implemented. Production apps must validate fonts and provide fallback options
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements
- Accessibility features are simplified for demonstration. Production apps must meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards

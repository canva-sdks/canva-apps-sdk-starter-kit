# Group elements

Demonstrates how to create group elements that contain multiple child elements positioned relative to each other. Shows grouping patterns for organizing related design elements.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/group-elements/.

See `app_element_children` for similar multi-element patterns, or other `design_elements` examples for individual element creation.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Content and grouping patterns are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading and group management interfaces
- Element hierarchy handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps should handle complex element hierarchies and support proper ungrouping functionality
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

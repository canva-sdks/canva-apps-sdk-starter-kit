# Table elements

Demonstrates how to create table elements with configurable rows, columns, cell spans, and formatting. Shows table structure definition, cell customization, and table insertion patterns.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/table-elements/.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Table structure and data are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading and table editing interfaces
- Data import and cell validation capabilities are not implemented. Production apps should include data import capabilities and cell validation
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

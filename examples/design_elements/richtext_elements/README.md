# Rich text elements

Demonstrates how to create and format rich text elements using RichtextRange API. Shows text formatting, paragraph styling, and rich text manipulation for creating styled text content.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/richtext-elements/.

Related examples: See design_elements/text_elements for basic text insertion, or content_replacement/richtext_replacement for modifying existing rich text.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content is hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading
- Text validation and formatting options are simplified for demonstration. Production apps should include proper text validation and comprehensive formatting options
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

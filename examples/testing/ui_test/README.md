# UI testing

Demonstrates how to set up and write tests for app UI components using standard testing frameworks. Shows basic component testing patterns and provides a foundation for testing user interactions.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: <https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/ui-test/>.

Related example: See testing/unit_test for testing app logic and business functions separately from UI.

NOTE: This example differs from what is expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Error handling is simplified for demonstration. Production apps must implement comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback and graceful failure modes
- Internationalization is not implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements

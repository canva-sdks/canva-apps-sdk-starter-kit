# App text elements

Demonstrates how to create text elements inside app elements with comprehensive styling controls including color, font weight, style, decoration, alignment, and dimensions. Shows text formatting within re-editable app elements.

For API reference docs and instructions on running this example, see: https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/examples/app-text-elements/.

Related examples: See `design_elements/text_elements` for direct text insertion, or `assets_and_media/fonts` for advanced font selection patterns.

NOTE: This example differs from what's expected for public apps to pass a Canva review:

- Text content and styling options are hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Production apps should provide user input interfaces or dynamic content loading and implement comprehensive text editing interfaces with proper font selection.
- Internationalization isn't implemented. Production apps must support multiple languages using the `@canva/app-i18n-kit` package to pass Canva review requirements.
- Accessibility features are simplified for demonstration. Production apps must meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards with proper keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.

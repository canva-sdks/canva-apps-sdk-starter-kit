 * (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should
 * permit loading resources.
 *
 * A basic CORS configuration would include the origin of your app in the
 * following example:
 * const corsOptions = {
 *   origin: 'https://app-abcdefg.canva-apps.com',
 *   optionsSuccessStatus: 200
 * }
 *
 * The origin of your app is https://app-${APP_ID}.canva-apps.com, and note
 * that the APP_ID should to be converted to lowercase.
 *
 * https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuring-cors
 *
 * You may need to include multiple permissible origins, or dynamic origins
 * based on the environment in which the server is running. Further
 * information can be found
 * [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuring-cors-w-dynamic-origin).
